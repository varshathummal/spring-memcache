/**
 * In SSM, you are able to identify 'key objects'. These are the objects that SSM will rely upon to generate a
 * (non-namespaced) part of the key for referring to values within the cache. This annotation indicates method that will
 * be used to generate a part of unique key. Annotated method has to confirm to the required signature: no-arg, with an
 * output of type {@link String}. If there is no conforming {@link CacheKeyMethod}, then the basic
 * {@link Object#toString()} method will be used. Since version 3.0.3 if there is no conforming {@link CacheKeyMethod}
 * in class but there is such method in superclass it will be used (instead of basic {@link Object#toString()}).
